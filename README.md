## 📌 Overview

Smart farming, also known as Agriculture 5.0, uses advanced technologies like AI, machine learning, and IoT (Internet of Things) to improve agricultural practices. This project is a step toward understanding how AI can analyze farming data and provide insights for better decision-making.

The notebook in this repository includes:

- 📊 Data analysis and visualization
- 🤖 AI or machine learning model (if included)
- 🌾 Use cases in smart farming
- 🧠 Human-centered AI concepts applied to agriculture

## 🧠 Purpose of This Project

This project was created for learning and demonstration purposes. It shows how Jupyter Notebooks can be used to:

- Analyze agricultural datasets
- Develop AI models that predict or classify crop behavior
- Visualize farming-related data
- Implement smart decisions based on data patterns

The project is part of an academic initiative, possibly under the domain of **Human-Centered AI in Agriculture 5.0**.
